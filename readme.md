# GNN Tracking Hyperparameter Optimization

> **Note** This is currently mostly a **dumping ground** for submission scripts
> related to the GNN Tracking project.  The code here is not yet intended to be
> collaboration.
> If you are interested in the project, check out [the main library](https://github.com/GageDeZoort/gnn_tracking).

## Setup

* You need [the main library](https://github.com/GageDeZoort/gnn_tracking)
* For synchronization with `wandb`, use [wandb-osh](github.com/klieret/wandb-offline-sync-hook/) (the hooks are already included in the tuning script, you only need to start `wandb-osh` on the head node)
